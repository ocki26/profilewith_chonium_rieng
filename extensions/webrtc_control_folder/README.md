## WebRTC Leak Prevent
**Version 2.0.0 | May 12 2025**

WebRTC Leak Prevent provides user control over WebRTC privacy settings in Chromium that have no native GUI. The intended use of the extension is to prevent [WebRTC leaks](https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/).

The only required permissions are 'privacy' and 'storage'.

#### How it works

In **Chromium version 48+**, the extension provides user control over `webRTCIPHandlingPolicy`, defaulting to `default_public_interface_only`.

#### Download

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-leak-prevent/eiadekoaikejlgdbkbdfeijglgfdalml)

#### Privacy

WebRTC Leak Prevent does not collect any user data. 

The extension is hosted entirely on GitHub and the Chrome Web Store. These services may independently collect user data.
